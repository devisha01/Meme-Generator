This application is a meme generator. It allows users to customize their own memes. It asks the user to input a text in the url that is then displayed on the image. This is an entertaining application whereby the user can choose what text he wants to be displayed on the image. Its used as a form of expression represented by the final image. The text entered is styled and aligned by the application. This is coded in php and the json files are returned after compilation. It can be used as a means of creating your own meme with customized test and the given image.
It is run on apache2 server on ubuntu. It is then contained in a docker instance. A docker instance is started and the images are contained. The service is packaged in the container such that when /startme.sh is executed, it runs the service on port 80 in the container.

Further Improvement:

There is much scope for further implementation of this application. It could be more user friendly and customizable. User should be able to choose the image he wants to upload and the text desired. He should be able to enter two different texts that can be placed differently on the image. Also, image could have more properties for adjusting like rotation,cropping,etc.
There could be further uses of the meme generator in creating your own memes and also different objects could be placed on the image like the popular dress up games online have. This would create a more graphic view of the website. The coding could have been more formatted and in depth. The program should extend to formulate the use of meme generator on a large
scale. It could have been more dynamic in its structure and view. There should be better implementation of functional programming. This would have further improved the site and made it more useful and convenient to all of users accessing it.
